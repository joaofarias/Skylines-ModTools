# Unity-ModTools
Mod debugging/ reverse engineering tool for Unity games.

Based on the popular ModTools originally developed for Cities:Skylines by [nLight](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=409520576) and further maintained by [BloodyPenguin](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=450877484). Credits to both of them.

## How to use

Reference this library from your mod and call ModToolsBootstrap.Bootstrap() to enable it.

In-game, press Ctrl+Q to open the menu.

## Known Issues

- The script compiler is disabled at the moment because it used a Cities:Skylines feature to compile scripts in place. I will try to provide a workaround soon.
